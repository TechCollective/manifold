Connects different tools IT people use. Currently it connects Autotask and UniFi Network Servers (Unifi Controllers) mainly used for alerts


The below was auto generated by "concert" and I have not audited it yet. I have not tested any of the below information.
I'm leaving the below here for me to clean up later.

## Installation

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python setup.py install
```

## Plugin requirements
'''
$ pip install -r manifoldcli/plugins/unifi_plugin/requirements.txt

$ pip install -r manifoldcli/plugins/autotask_plugin/requirements.txt
'''

## Development

This project includes a number of helpers in the `Makefile` to streamline common development tasks.

### Environment Setup

The following demonstrates setting up and working with a development environment:

```
### create a virtualenv for development

$ make virtualenv

$ source .venv/bin/activate


### run manifoldcli cli application

$ manifoldcli --help

### setup the environment

$ mkdir .env
$ chmod -R o-rwx .env
$ manifoldcli unifi add-controller
$ 



### run pytest / coverage

$ make test
```


### Releasing to PyPi

Before releasing to PyPi, you must configure your login credentials:

**~/.pypirc**:

```
[pypi]
username = YOUR_USERNAME
password = YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Then use the included helper function via the `Makefile`:

```
$ make dist

$ make dist-upload
```

## Deployments

### Docker

Included is a basic `Dockerfile` for building and distributing `Manifold CLI`,
and can be built with the included `make` helper:

```
$ make docker

$ docker run -it manifoldcli --help
```
